# Everytrack (Concept sample)

## About

Everytrack is a fictional song management application that I documented as part of a job application process. Although Everytrack is a fictional product, I would have consulted the following subject matter experts during the research and review stages of its documentation:

- Product Manager - To understand the product vision, key features, and intended user experience.
- Developers - To clarify technical implementation details, API behavior, system architecture, and any constraints that impact documentation.
- Quality Assurance team - To understand common issues found during testing, edge cases, and areas where users may struggle.
- Sales team members - To gather insights into customer expectations, objections, and selling points.
- Support team - To gain insight into customer pain points after the product was launched.

## The concept 
In version 1 Everytrack lays the foundation for managing your music library with ease. But this is just the beginning.

Everytrack is more than just a music library app, it's designed to be your personal music journey companion. The app aims to provide a deeper, more insightful experience by helping you track and explore the music you love.
