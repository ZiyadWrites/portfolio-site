This is an instructional guide for a fictional software product called "Omnichat." Although this is based on a real product I documented, I have altered certain details to avoid sharing confidential or proprietary information.

# Connecting WhatsApp Business with OmniChat

Integrating your WhatsApp Business account with Omnichat CPaaS (Cloud Platform as a service) allows you to engage with your customers more efficiently through one of the most popular messaging platforms. By connecting your account, you can streamline your communications, automate messages, and manage conversations all in one place, helping you save time and build stronger relationships with your audience.

## Before you start

Things you need to know:

- Ensure your mobile number can receive SMS.  
- Activate the Pay As You Go SMS payment plan on your Dotdigital account.  
- You need a Facebook personal profile. 

## Integrating WhatsApp Business with Omnichat CPaaS

Now that you're ready, you can begin creating a business profile in WhatsApp that will be integrated with Omnichat. To set up the link between your WhatsApp Business account and Omnichat, you must be logged into your Facebook account.

1. In Omnichat, go to **Settings > Whatsapp > Manage Connection**.
2. Select the **Connect Whatsapp** button.
3. Select the **Get Started** button. 
  
      
> **Important:** Read the WhatsApp Business Terms of Service, the Meta Business Terms of Service, and Omnichat's Privacy Policy and Terms.

### 1. Create a business portfolio
   
Your business portfolio will be associated with your WhatsApp business number. Your audience will not see this information on your WhatsApp profile. The information that you enter for your profile will allow you to represent your business while keeping sensitive details private.

\- Select **Create a business portfolio**.  
\- Enter your  **Business name**.  
\- Enter your **Business email**.  
\- Provide the URL for your **Business website or profile page**.  
> If you do not have a business website, you can provide a URL for any of your business-related social media pages.  
>   
\- Select your **Country**.  
\- Select **Next**.  


### 2. Create a Whatsapp business profile
Your WhatsApp business profile displays key information about your business to users on WhatsApp. You can update it anytime by navigating to Business Assets in Meta Business Suite settings and selecting your WhatsApp account.

\- Enter your **WhatsApp Business Account Name**.  
\- Enter your **WhatsApp business display name**.  

:::note

Ensure your display name adheres to the [Whatsapp display name guidelines](https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/757569725593362).

:::

\- Select the **Category** that best describes your business.    
\- Select **Next**. 


### 3. Add and verify your WhatsApp phone number
In this step, you'll add your WhatsApp phone number and verify it to complete the setup of your WhatsApp Business account.

\- Select the **Phone number code** for your region and then enter your phone number.  
> You can use the phone number linked to your Facebook account, enter a new number, or migrate a number already registered with WhatsApp Messenger or the WhatsApp Business app.
> 
\- Select either the **Text message** or **Phone call** method to verify your WhatsApp phone number.   
\- Select **Next**.  
\- Enter your **Verification code**. 


### 4. Confirm permissions and save settings

To complete the connection of your WhatsApp Business account to Omnichat, you'll need to grant certain permissions to manage WhatsApp.


\- Review the permissions and then click **Save**.  
\- If successful, your WhatsApp account details will be displayed.


Your WhatsApp Business account is now fully integrated with Omnichat, and you're ready to start managing communications.
