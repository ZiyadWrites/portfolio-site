# EveryTrack (concept sample)

## About

Much of my previous writing has been focused on work-related materials that cannot be shared. Everytrack on the other hand is about an imaginary song management application that I developed as part of a job application process. Although My Everytrack is not based on a real product the subject matter experts that I would have consulted during my research and review stages for documenting this product would have been:

- Product Manager
- Developers
- Quality Assurance team
- Sales team members
- Support team (to gain insight into customer pain points after the product was launched)
