Good API documentation must contain the following elements:

- ## Resource description  
    Ensure that the description is action-oriented and provides a concise summary of 1â€“3 sentences, addressing key details efficiently.

- ## Endpoint and methods  
    Determine how they are grouped, whether they appear on a single page or across multiple pages, and whether they are organized by method or resource. Ensure that each endpoint's methods are clearly specified.

- ## Parameters  
    Identify the different types used (header, path, query string, or request body) for each endpoint. Ensure that data types (e.g., string, boolean) are clearly defined and that required or optional values are specified.

- ## Request example  
     Specify the format or language used (e.g., cURL, specific programming languages) and ensure that the sample request includes all relevant parameters
  
- ## Response example and schema  
      Include both a sample response and a response schema, ensuring that each element is clearly described. Consider how nested hierarchies are presented to maintain clarity in the response definitions.
